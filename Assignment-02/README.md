# 📚 CoT vs ToT Prompting Assignment

## 📝 Objective

Understand the difference between **Chain of Thought (CoT)** and **Tree of Thoughts (ToT)** Prompting, and create a LinkedIn post summarizing insights.

## 1️⃣ Short Explanation

**Chain of Thought (CoT) Prompting**

* CoT prompts guide AI to think **step by step** in a linear sequence.
* Helps in **breaking complex problems into smaller steps** for logical reasoning.

**Tree of Thoughts (ToT) Prompting**

* ToT prompts allow AI to explore **multiple possible paths** of reasoning.
* Generates a **decision tree**, considering different options before choosing the best solution.



## 2️⃣ Key Differences

| Feature             | Chain of Thought (CoT)             | Tree of Thoughts (ToT)                               |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Reasoning Structure | Linear / sequential                | Branching / multiple paths                           |
| Approach            | Step-by-step thinking              | Explore options and evaluate paths                   |
| Complexity Handling | Simple to moderately complex tasks | Complex tasks requiring evaluation of alternatives   |
| Output              | Single solution path               | Multiple potential solution paths, best one selected |


## 3️⃣ Real-World Example (Simple)

**CoT Example (Step-by-step):**

* Task: Decide what to eat for lunch.
* Step-by-step reasoning:

  1. Am I hungry? → Yes
  2. Do I want something light or heavy? → Light
  3. What options are available? → Salad, Sandwich, Soup
  4. Choose → Salad

**ToT Example (Multiple options):**

* Task: Decide what to eat for lunch.
* Multiple paths:

  * Option 1 → Salad → Check ingredients → Ready to eat → Choose
  * Option 2 → Sandwich → Check ingredients → Missing items → Discard
  * Option 3 → Soup → Too long to cook → Discard
* Best choice → Salad

> **Key idea:** CoT follows **one linear reasoning**, ToT explores **many options before picking the best**.
